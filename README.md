# Nightwach.js Custom Assertion Demo

Demonstrates how to automate browser testing using Nightwatch.js. This
particular demo shows how to create a custom assertion that counts the number
of elements matching a given CSS selector. The test uses this assertion to
ensure that [lansing.codes](https://www.lansing.codes) shows a calendar of the
next four weeks (28 days) worth of Meetups.

For a brief overview of browser automation testing and Nightwatch.js,
